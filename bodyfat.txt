Problems:

Using your programming language / IDE of choice, please perform:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset.  This should include visualizations that you find meaningful/helpful in learning about this new dataset.

2) A correlation Analysis of the dataset.  Which data elements (if any) are highly correlated with one another?  What might be the best way to handle the ones that are (if any)?

3) You may encounter missing (NULL) data in some features. Implement an imputation strategy to improve the performance of your machine learning.  

4) Using a machine learning algorithm of your choice, build a model that predicts BodyFat.  Describe your training/testing approach.  Choose what you feel to be a reasonable measure of model accuracy/effectiveness.
